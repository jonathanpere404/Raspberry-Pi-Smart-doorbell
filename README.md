# Raspberry-Pi-Smart-doorbell
# Smart doorbell made from raspberry pi

Backround to get it working. 

I had problems with the new version of Raspberry Pi OS "Bullseye" at the time. The problems was with OpenCV installation, speakers and touchscreen. I could not get them to work. Maby Bullsey works better now, but i choose older "Buster" operating system for this project.

## Before you get it to working
This Smart Doorbell system works with Telegrambot. First you need to get BOT and (Token/API key) to use it.

## You need to install them aswell
```
sudo apt-get install python-opencv

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libjasperdev libqtgui4 python3-pyqt5 libqt4-test libilmbase-dev libopenexr-dev
libgstreamer1.0-dev libavcodec58 libavformat58 libswscale5

sudo pip3 install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
