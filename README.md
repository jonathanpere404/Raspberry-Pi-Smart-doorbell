# Raspberry-Pi-Smart-doorbell
 Facial recognition smart doorbell made from raspberry pi

Backround to get it working. 

I had problems with the new version of Raspberry Pi OS "Bullseye" at the time. I had problems with OpenCV installation, speakers and touchscreen didn't work. Maby Bullsey works now, but i choose older "Buster" operating system for this project.  

This Smart Doorbell system works with Telegrambot. First you need to get bot Token/API key
